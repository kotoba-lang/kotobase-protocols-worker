  "Bridge Cloudflare R2 (async) to the engine's SYNC block reader.

  cold-datoms / hydrate-db walk a prolly-tree through a synchronous
  `(get-fn cid) -> bytes`, but R2 `.get` is a Promise. `with-blocks` runs such a
  sync computation against an in-memory block cache and, on a cache miss, fetches
  the block from R2 and retries — a block-miss trampoline. Correct for any tree
  shape; efficient once the read touches few blocks (prolly-tree prefix pruning,
  the #13 follow-up). Pure enough to test with a promise-returning fake `fetch1`."
