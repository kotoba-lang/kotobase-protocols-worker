  "EXPLICIT plaintext-passthrough profile for kotobase-peer's REQUIRED
  `blind-fn`/`encrypt-fn`/`decrypt-fn` seam (ADR-2607051000, accepted
  2026-07-06 — the engine takes these with NO silent default, so every
  caller states its at-rest crypto posture instead of assuming one; same
  convention as the handler's explicit `(constantly true)` `visible?`).

  This profile keeps at-rest bytes PLAINTEXT — behaviorally identical to the
  pre-seam worker, chosen deliberately as the adoption step's interim:
  real per-graph keys (HPKE-wrapped DEKs, HMAC blind tokens, AES-256-GCM via
  `crypto.subtle`) are ADR-2607051000's own follow-up and land as a swap of
  THESE three fns, nothing else. All three are trivially deterministic,
  which `fold!` requires of `encrypt-fn` (content-addressed convergence).

  Platform split (kotobase-peer's contract): synchronous values on JVM,
  `js/Promise`s on cljs (where the real implementations will be
  `crypto.subtle` calls, which are Promise-only)."
